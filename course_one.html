            <p>Each weeks' slides are linked below along with an overview which is intended as a brief lesson plan. It is there as a guide - but you have complete flexibility how to present. If you would like any more information or tips/advice on how to present please do get in touch. I try to use a few visual aids too - such as an inflatable globe. See below for a few useful tips on running the lessons.
            
            <P>In addition to the slides for talking and presenting information there are some ideas and plans for activities. The first one being making some Top Trumps cards which are very popular. Other activities include displays for noticeboards and assembly outlines.

          <h3>1. What is Climate?</h3>
          <p><li>OK, so start at the beginning - what is Climate? it's connected to weather, but not the same. These slides help explain some basics of why the world has weather, and how climate refers to the long-term average of weather. We intuitively know that some places are hot or cold, dry pr wet - discuss this with the class and see if they can name some places for each category.
          <p>
          <li>Bonus points if they can talk about the less obvious feeatures: e.g. hot places are generally near the equator - but what are the exceptions? Mt. Everest is pretty cold, despite being in the tropics. Or when talking about places where it rains a lot - don't forget over the ocean! or deserts can be cold - the Antarctic gets very little precipitation
          <p>
          <li>The you can talk about seasons - climate is more than just the average for the year. Some places are characterised by hot and cold seasons, or maybe wet and dry seasons. There are som examples to go over - can the class guess where each of these places is by the characteristics of the seasons - feel free to add or replace with examples relevant to you </p>
          <P>
          <li>At the end of the lesson introduce the activity for the next few weeks - you're going to make some Top Trumps cards. See the section below for more details on this activity...

          <h3>2. Why is Climate Changing?</h3>
          <p>
          <li>Once we know what climate is we can discuss why it changes. We know it cn change naturally - over millions of years there are numerous natural causes from moving continents to changing orbits, volcanoes and meteor strikes. But _now_ it is changing much faster and it can only be human-caused. We know the basic physics too well to leave any uncertainty here</p>
          <P>
          <li>These slides introduce the idea of greenhouse gases and where they come from - primarily CO2. It comes from all of our activity - mainly now from burning fuels, but previously lots from deforestation too. There is more CO2 in the atmosphere now than for at least a million years. Some catchy animations show how our emissions have increased and so has global temperature</p>
          <P>
          <li>Kids love fun facts and figures - your car can drink a can-of-coke's worth of petrol every 3 minutes. Try doing that yourself! Then imagine all the cars on all the roads. It quickly adds up to a crushing amount of carbon being burned.
          <P>

          <h3>Top Trumps</h3>
          
          <p>Everyone loves Top Trumps. If you haven't played this before then it is based around a pack of cards where each card contains a related object (they can cover anything from fast cars to Dr. Who characters) which scores on a range of categories. Players play off their cards against others choosing a category and seeing if their card beats others. I'll leave you to look up the rules if you need to!
          
          <P>Here we make some Top Trumps cards based on countries and their climate, population and CO2 emissions. The goal here is to give the kids some experience of gathering data and doing their own research.
          
          <P>This activity can take at least a couple of weeks. It depends how many children you've got, time etc. It does require them to have internet access to a common spreadsheet for editing. Typically I use google spreadsheet, but other online ones are available. You will need to speak to your school teacher/IT department to find out exactly what is appropriate and accessible. Schools I've worked with generally have Chromebooks available and each pupil has their own google-classroom account. But please find the solution which works for you.
          
          <P>The links opposite give some resources to download. The steps needed are listed below
          
          <ul>
          <li>Assemble a list of 24 countries. You can do this in advance or (better) let the children choose. You might want to show a world map or just ask them if they have visited (or lived in) any where overseas. If needed you can guide them - it's good to aim for good coverage of different climate zones and continents. 
          <ul>
          <li>I try to do this step at the end of the first week. You'll see a slide for this (pre-populated, but please edit) at the end of the slides for week 1.
          </ul>
          
          <li>You can then set up a google spreadsheet (or equivalent) with these countries. Use the template linked to the right. That example is populated with all the numbers, so you will have to clear these and fill in your own countries
          <P>
          
          <li>Display the google sheet by projector, and make sure the kids can access it through their own account. This will need some help from the school IT support, and is worth testing in advance! But once set up it works very well.
          
          <li>Allocate each pupil a country and get them to spend this week filling in the temperature and rainfall columns. They can google for "Canada's hottest temperature" or "Brazil annual rainfall" and fill in the lines of the spreadsheet. Then move on to another country.
          <ul>
          <li>It is great to watch the sheet populate on the big screen - with multiple pupils editing at once it moves very quickly!
          <li>Explain the importance of units. Ideally get them to input in common units - I would suggest degrees centigrade and mm of rain per year.
          <li>After they have done this, some quality control may be needed - you can encourage them to think about this - are the answers you put in sensible? If Canada's hottest temperature is higher than Egypt for example, does this make sense? If Brazil's hottest temperature is -10 does that make sense?
          <li>But I also find it fine to leave in small errors - in the sheet you download you may find errors and inconsistencies - that's fine. Mistakes are inevitable and it is not the goal here achieve perfect outcome, but to learn by the process. 
          </ul>
          
          <li>Next week you will cover greenhouse gases - after that you can fill in the rest of the columns
          <p>
          
          <li>For columns on land area and population - again google is a good source of information. For CO2 emissions, I use the <a href="http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions"><u><i>Global Carbon Atlas</i></u></a> which is a very reputable scientific source - you can very easily see the emissions for each country and this is updated to the latest year as soon as they can.
