            <h1>About Climate Club</h1>
            <p>Climate Club is a STEM outreach activity which aims to provide free teaching resources for schools and clubs to learn about climate and climate change - it's causes, impacts and solutions.</p>

            <P>It was set up in 2022 by Dr Chris Jones and ran first at Exminster Community Primary School</P>

            <P>The intention is to create a volunteer-run club which provides climate education for primary school children and aids teachers and schools include climate and environmental education without additional teaching load. The lessons are meant to be fun, engaging and interactive</P>

            <h2 id="CJ">About Me</h2>
            <P><a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/chris-jones">Chris Jones</a> is a UK climate scientist. He has worked at the Met Office Hadley Centre - the UK's national climate centre - for about 30 years and is an internationally respected expert in climate change. He has been a lead author on multiple <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/">IPCC reports</a> and is recognised as a <a href="https://clarivate.com/highly-cited-researchers/">"highly cited" </a> researcher. You can also <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisd_jones">follow me (@chrisd_jones) on Twitter</a>
            
            <P>My work involves writing computer programmes to model how climate affects our natural ecosystems and how the carbon cycle helps reduce the amount of CO2 pollution in the atmosphere. I lead a research programme with partners in Brazil and have visited research sites in the Amazon rainforest.
            
            <P>I am passionate about teaching environmental issues and science to children, and especially enjoy working with older primary school classes. I led a collection of articles in a Science journal for kids called <a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/collections/17393/climate-change">"Frontiers for Young Minds"</a>. I set up and run Climate Club for the same reason - to enable kids to get access to factually correct science about climate and climate change.
            
            <P>I am a <a href="https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors">STEM ambassador</a>, and fully DBS checked. I have up to date Safeguarding training required to work in schools
