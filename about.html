            <h1>About Climate Club</h1>
            <p>Climate Club is a STEM outreach activity which aims to provide free teaching resources for schools and clubs to learn about climate and climate change - its causes, impacts and solutions.</p>

            <P>It was set up in 2022 by Dr Chris Jones and ran first at Exminster Community Primary School. As of 2025 I have delivered this multiple times in Exminster and introduced it at St Nicholas and Pinhoe schools.</P>

            <P>In 2025 Climate Club was recognised by an award for Excellence in Volunteering by STEM South West.</P>
            
            <P>listen to this 1-minute explainer, or see more detail in the videos below for teachers, parents and pupils

            <P>The intention is to create a volunteer-run club which provides climate education for primary school children and aids teachers and schools include climate and environmental education without additional teaching load. The lessons are meant to be fun, engaging and interactive</P>

            <h2 id="CJ">About Me</h2>
            <P><a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/chris-jones">Dr. Chris Jones</a> is a UK climate scientist. He has worked at the Met Office Hadley Centre - the UK's national climate centre - for more than 30 years and is an internationally respected expert in climate change. He is also Professor of Climate Science at the University of Bristol. He has been a lead author on multiple <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/">IPCC reports</a> and is recognised as a <a href="https://clarivate.com/highly-cited-researchers/">"highly cited" </a> researcher.</a>
            
            <P>I obtained a first class degree in Natural Sciences from the University of Cambridge in 1993, and a PhD in Climate Science from University of Exeter. My work involves writing computer programmes to model how climate affects our natural ecosystems and how the carbon cycle helps reduce the amount of CO2 pollution in the atmosphere. I have led multiple projects including a research programme with <a href="https://www.viewpoint-brazil.org">partners in Brazil</a> and have visited research sites in the Amazon rainforest.
            
            <P>I am passionate about teaching environmental issues and science to children, and especially enjoy working with older primary school classes. I have led the writing of two special collections of papers written specifically for school kids in the science journal called <a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/">"Frontiers for Young Minds"</a>:
               <ul>
                 <li><a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/collections/17393/climate-change">"Climate Collection"</a> explains the basic science behind what we know about Climate Change
                 <li><a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/collections/59311/climate-change-volume-2">"Climate Collection vol. 2"</a> explains wider issues covered by the IPCC including Climate Justice and Finance and the impacts and solutions to Climate Change.
               </ul>  
             I set up and run Climate Club for the same reason - to enable kids to get access to factually correct science about climate and climate change.
            
            <P>I am a <a href="https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors">STEM ambassador</a>, and fully DBS checked. I have up to date Safeguarding training required to work in schools
